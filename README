This is just a sketch of a nanite agent that can handle tasks related to deployment.

Right now it manages rabbitmq, monit and init.d services plus a cached remote git deploy stategy.
THe git remote cache code is straight up stolen from capistrano for now. I think I might just use
cap as a library though and just bypass net/ssh all together since the commands are effectively run
locally where the agent runs anyway.

So feedback welcome, want to make this work seamlessly. Right now it does not have proper error 
reporting or logging or any must haves like that but its a start.
